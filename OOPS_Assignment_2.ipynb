By inheriting from ABC, a class becomes an abstract base class and can define abstract methods using the @abstractmethod decorator. An abstract method is a method that only contains the method signature without an implementation.\n",

This prevents users from directly accessing or modifying the internal data, promoting data security and integrity.\n",
