    "SQL databases use a structured query language (SQL) to store and retrieve data. SQL is a standard language that is used by most relational databases. Relational databases store data in tables, which are made up of rows and columns.\n",

    "DROP is used to delete database objects. For example, the following statement drops the customers table:\n",
    "SQL\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",

    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(255);\n",

    "TRUNCATE is used to delete all the rows from a table, but it does not delete the table itself. For example, the following statement truncates the customers table:\n",

    "The purpose of a foreign key is to establish a relationship between two tables. A foreign key in one table refers to the primary key of another table. This allows us to relate the data in the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a table called `customers` and a table called `orders`. The `customers` table has a primary key called `id`. The `orders` table has a foreign key called `customer_id` that references the `id` column in the `customers` table. This means that each row in the `orders` table must have a corresponding row in the `customers` table.\n",
